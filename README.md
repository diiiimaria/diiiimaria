| Avoid using vendor-supplied defaults for system or admin passwords.                 | PAM systems enforce strict password management policies. This includes mandatory changes from default passwords and regular password rotation. This ensures secure password management in compliance with PCI DSS. |
| Restrict access to payment cardholder data to individuals with a business need to know. | PAM systems enforce the principle of least privilege by granting access only to users who require it for their job functions. Detailed access controls ensure data access restrictions. Just-in-time access capabilities further limit exposure of sensitive data to authorized personnel under specific conditions. |
| Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.              | PAM solutions provide comprehensive tracking and monitoring of privileged access. Detailed audit logs and real-time monitoring detect unauthorized access attempts or suspicious behavior. Automatic session termination capabilities mitigate security risks promptly. |
| Facilitate secure remote access.                                                    | PAM systems control remote access to privileged accounts based on user roles and IP addresses, ensuring secure access to sensitive data compliant with PCI DSS.                      |
