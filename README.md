| Ensure data protection and privacy by design and by default.                           | PAM systems implement data protection by design and by default through strict access controls and regular audits. These systems ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data. |
| Restrict access to personal data to authorized individuals only.                       | PAM systems enforce the principle of least privilege by restricting access to personal data based on user roles and job functions. Just-in-time access and detailed access controls ensure that only those with a legitimate need can access personal data. |
| Maintain detailed records of processing activities.                                    | PAM solutions provide comprehensive audit logs of privileged access and activities. These logs include details about who accessed what data and when, aiding in compliance with GDPR record-keeping requirements. |
| Implement measures to ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access.             | PAM systems incorporate features such as real-time monitoring, session recording, and automatic session termination to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data security. |
| Facilitate secure remote access to data.                                                | PAM systems manage secure remote access by controlling and monitoring access based on user roles, IP addresses, and other criteria, ensuring that remote access to personal data is secure and compliant with GDPR. |
